* Configuration

* Database creation

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


NOTES

* Why I chose Ruby on Rails
  * It's what I'm familiar with
  * Out of the box support for command-line app
    and web app using the same code
  * It's worth pointing out that the rails installation is an
    api only. However, it still contains more functionality than necessary (i.e. mailers, db support, etc)


Assumptions
 
* Command line app
  * There are always 3 files (not 1 or 2)
  * The files are persisted in the codebase
* Files
  * no header
  * Dates are consistently formatted like 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  * Gender is either 'male' or 'female'. consistently spelled
  * No duplicates across files
  * No leading/trailing whitespaces
